# Location

Hi. (I thought that keeping the socket program in a seperate branch and working on the Django project in the master branch would be more appropriate.)

Simply git-clone the project and then run 'python3 manage.py runserver' inside Location folder(if you have Django installed). You should be able to see the list of maps at 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/eventmap/' .
